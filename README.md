## Design Process

My Website: https://eatingbizkuits.github.io/assignment_1-Portfolio/

As a student, I want employers and friends to see it, so that they can get to know me better.
This webpage was inspired by a senior and some paper sketches were done, but I lost it in the end. (So sorry) 

Senior's webpage: 

## Features

Existing Features:

Navbar - User can hover over sitename and navigation options. A simple color change animation or line animation respectively can be seen. On click, will bring you to the respective sections.

Head/Intro - A simple background image of myself with a gray overlay. A typing carousel and a cool spinning box I saw in w3schools. Cool and simple intro

AboutMe - Simple descriptions and picture of myself and secondary school friends. Posing in front of the camera and smiling! Cheese! Basic Description of my skills and proficiencies represented as a skill wheel.

Exeperiences/My Life - Simple top down timeline of my educational journey: Secondary -> Polytechnic (Current)

Survey/Form - Simple "Talk to me" Survey where anyone can send. Picture of dog alone (send some message to me)

notes.txt are citations!

Features Left to Implement:
I wished I had more time to do the redirect for my website. 
I cant seem to get it to work and scroll to a certain area.
Maybe better device compatibility? Scaling Issues


JQuery (not too familiar)
This website uses JQuery for the simple animations: 
Navbar (Logo, Navbar-options)

Javascript (better familiarity)
Typing Carousel



Form does not collect anything. Dont be afraid to send things over!
